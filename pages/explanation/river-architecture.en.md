# The River Architecture

River Review flows with your development process.

Conceptually, the flow has three major segments (see [Upstream / Midstream / Downstream phases](./upstream-midstream-downstream.md)):

- **Upstream**: requirements, architecture, ADR, design
- **Midstream**: implementation, refactoring, CI integration
- **Downstream**: QA, test analysis, release checks

A fourth layer -- [**Riverbed Memory**](./riverbed-memory.md) -- stores contextual decisions so that subsequent reviews can reuse them.

River Review is a **context engineering framework**. It systematically selects, filters, and assembles context—skills, diffs, and memory—to maximize review quality within a bounded context window. Progressive disclosure ensures that only the necessary level of detail is loaded at each stage, preventing attention dilution.

## Review Team (parallel perspective-based reviewers)

Beyond a single general-purpose review, the review runner provides **parallel orchestration of perspective-based reviewer roles**, implemented in `src/lib/reviewer-orchestrator.mjs`.

- **Roles**: bug-hunter / security-scanner / test-gap / dependency-reviewer / frontend-reviewer / ci-cd-reviewer, each treated as an independent reviewer.
- **Automatic selection**: with `--reviewers auto`, `selectRolesAuto` picks roles from the diff content and risk signals. To select explicitly, pass a comma-separated list such as `--reviewers bug-hunter,security-scanner`.
- **Parallel fan-out**: role × chunk pairs run in parallel via `Promise.allSettled`, so a failure in one role does not discard the results of the others.
- **Merge**: findings from each role are grouped via connected-components, and `mergeFindings` consolidates duplicate or adjacent findings.

This is a single orchestrator running perspective-based roles in parallel and merging the results, not a swarm of autonomous agents. Each role only produces review material; it has no authority to decide or approve.

```

## Agent layer (generate → review → revise loop)

River Review can be embedded as the **review stage** of a generating agent's **generate → review → revise** loop (Epic #1150).

- River Review acts as a **critic** that returns findings / verdict / `suggestedLoopSignal`.
- Deciding whether to iterate, stop, or escalate is the **caller's responsibility** (the calling agent). River Review does not run the loop itself; it only returns material for the decision.
- Findings and verdict are decision material, not auto-approval. The design preserves a human confirmation boundary (HITL).

For the contract and reference implementation, see:

- Contract: [Loop Convergence Contract](../reference/loop-convergence-contract.en.md)
- Reference implementation: `examples/loop-reference-agent/` (a minimal loop that satisfies the contract)

## Representative flow (GitHub Actions)

```mermaid

  participant GH as GitHub Actions
  participant Repo as Repository
  participant River as river-review (action/cli)
  participant LLM as LLM API

  GH->>Repo: checkout (fetch-depth: 0)
  GH->>River: run (phase=midstream)
  River->>Repo: compute merge-base / diff
  River->>River: select skills (selected/skipped)
  alt dry-run / missing API key
    River->>River: fallback findings
  else LLM enabled
    River->>LLM: prompt (skills + context)
    LLM-->>River: review output
  end
  River-->>GH: findings / summary
```

## Representative flow (local)

```mermaid

  participant Dev as Developer

  Dev->>River: river run . (--debug/--dry-run)
  River->>Repo: diff/merge-base

  River-->>Dev: plan + findings (+ debug)
```

## CLI-first execution surface and resolution order

The **canonical execution surface of River Review is the CLI**. GitHub Action / Claude Code command / Codex skill / MCP / shell are designed as thin wrappers that call this CLI (e.g. the GitHub Action is a thin adapter: `runners/github-action/src/index.mjs` merely imports `src/cli.mjs`). Review judgement, skill resolution, and gate decisions live in the CLI, not in each surface.

- **Command name**: both `river` and `river-review` bins point to `src/cli.mjs`. In agent-facing docs and examples, prefer `river-review` to avoid ambiguity.
- **Subcommands**: `river-review run <path>` (local diff review), `river-review review plan|exec|verify` (artifact-driven gate), `river-review skills <subcommand>`.
- **JSON is the first-class output**: the Review Artifact conforming to `schemas/review-artifact.schema.json` (`version: "1"`) is the machine-readable contract. PR inline comments / Checks / Markdown summary / dashboard / agent handoff are adapters that transform this JSON (`--output markdown` is a human-facing derived view).

### skill / gate / config resolution order

Which skills / gates / rules are ultimately selected is resolved deterministically and can be inspected via `--debug` output (`plan.selectedSkills` / `skippedSkills` with reasons). Precedence (highest first):

1. **CLI explicit options** — `--skill-set` / `--context` / `--dependency`, etc. (the config file is auto-detected from the repo root, not via a `--config` flag; see below)
2. **Repository local** — `.river-review.{json,yaml,yml}` (`src/config/loader.mjs`), `.river/rules.md` + `.river/rules.d/*.md`, `skills/registry.yaml`
3. **User global** — `~/.river-review/config.{json,yaml,yml}` (`src/config/loader.mjs`). Always applies as a user-wide base. When a repository-local config exists, it is merged on top of the global one (repository-local wins). On CI or shared hosts where a stray global config must not silently change review behavior, set `RIVER_REVIEW_DISABLE_GLOBAL_CONFIG=1` to disable this tier.
4. **Built-in** — bundled skills and defaults

### No auto-update

The CLI / Action ship no auto-update mechanism. Consumers pin and update versions explicitly (GitHub Action version pinning, npm lockfiles). This is a deliberate choice favoring deterministic execution and auditability.
