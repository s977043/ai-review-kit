This page explains why River Review itself is safe by design. For how to report a vulnerability, see [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/s977043/river-review/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

## Skills are not executable code

A River Review skill is a Markdown file — frontmatter plus a prompt body. There are no `scripts/` directories under `skills/`, and a skill never runs a shell or code.

"Executing" a skill means sending its prompt and the diff to an LLM to obtain review text. The pipeline uses no `eval` / `vm` / dynamic `require`, and there is no code-execution sink that consumes the diff. The deterministic detectors are regex matches only, and the `git` / `rg` calls use array-argument `execFile` with no shell.

## Reviews are read-only

Review output is a set of `<file>:<line>: <message>` findings. Output that does not match the format is dropped, and the fallback is limited to deterministic heuristics. River Review does not change code; it only surfaces findings and a verdict as decision material.

## Humans keep the final decision (human-in-the-loop)

- The GitHub Action defaults to `dry_run: true`.
- It posts to the PR as a `COMMENT` only — there is no approve or auto-merge path.
- The deterministic gate can only escalate to human review; it has no way to push a decision toward GO.

So no finding can automatically approve, merge, or change code.

## Handling untrusted diffs

The diff is untrusted input placed into the prompt. That is the prompt-injection surface common to all LLM-based review, not a River-Review-specific defect. The worst a malicious diff can achieve is a wrong review comment that a human reads — because:

- Output is comment-only; injection cannot cause a merge or approval.
- Findings pass format validation, so free-form injected prose is dropped.
- The verifier rejects findings whose evidence references files not in the diff ([verifier](https://github.com/s977043/river-review/blob/main/src/lib/verifier.mjs)).
- The review rules forbid speculation beyond the diff.
- Secret redaction runs on both the input and the output.
- No dynamic code execution or deserialization happens, so an RCE-style "malicious payload" does not apply.

## Common misconceptions

- **"Large change → run all skills" is not code execution.** It means applying all review lenses (test coverage, naming, flakiness, and so on); no privileged operation or shell is involved.
- **It is not a replacement for static analysis.** Deterministic syntactic / type / known-pattern checks stay with dedicated tools; River Review complements them with semantic consistency.
