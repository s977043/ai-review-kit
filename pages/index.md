# River Reviewer docs

River Reviewer’s documentation is organized using the
[Diátaxis documentation framework](https://diataxis.fr/).

We group docs into four types:

- Tutorials – step-by-step lessons for new users
- How-to guides – recipes for achieving specific tasks
- Reference – technical specifications, APIs, schemas
- Explanation – background, design decisions, and concepts

A typical reading order could be:

1. Tutorials – if you are new to River Reviewer
2. How-to guides – if you want to solve a specific problem
3. Reference – when you need precise specs or API facts
4. Explanation – when you want to understand the "why"

Docs live under `pages/` and are served at `/docs`, mirroring these four types so you can quickly find what you need.
