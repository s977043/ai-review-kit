title: HTML Output Format (Self-contained Report)
description: River Review HTML output format and its per-command support matrix.
---

River Review emits a self-contained HTML report when you pass `--output html` (CLI) or `output_format: html` (GitHub Action). The CSS is inlined in a `<style>` block and no external stylesheet or script is loaded, so the file can be stored as a CI artifact and opened directly in a browser.

## Supported commands

The CLI accepts `text|markdown|json|yaml|html` for `--output` globally, but only a few commands actually render `html`.

| Command                                                                                                            | `--output html`  | Produces                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `river run <path>`                                                                                                 | Supported        | Review report (decision banner, score, findings, risk assessment) |
| `river runs diff <id1> <id2> [<id3>...]`                                                                           | Supported        | Loop dashboard (loop signal, churn, oscillation timeline)         |
| `river review plan` / `river review exec`                                                                          | Rejected, exit 3 | Use `json` or `markdown`                                          |
| `river evolve aggregate` / `river evolve replay`                                                                   | Rejected, exit 1 | Use `text` or `json`                                              |
| Everything else (`river review route`, `river runs list`, `river runs digest`, `river promote`, `river skills`, …) | Ignored          | Falls back to that command's default output                       |

The rejecting commands print:

```text
$ river review plan --output html
Error: Unsupported output format "html" for river review. Expected: json | markdown (text not yet implemented).

$ river evolve aggregate --output html
Unsupported --output for evolve aggregate: html. Use: text | json
```

## CLI

River Review is not published to npm, so the CLI is run inside the repository with `npm run river -- ...`.

```bash
npm run river -- run . --output html
```

Stdout carries the `npm run` banner lines and the `river run` header (a few lines starting with `River Review (local)`) before the HTML body. For `markdown` / `json` / `yaml` that header goes to stderr, but for `html` it stays on stdout. Strip everything before the doctype when you need a clean HTML file:

```bash
npm run river -- run . --output html | sed -n '/<!DOCTYPE html>/,$p' > review-report.html
```

The loop dashboard is generated from two or more stored run records (`.river/runs/`). Oscillation detection needs three or more run ids; with exactly two the oscillation timeline is empty.

```bash
npm run river -- runs diff <run-id-1> <run-id-2> --output html | sed -n '/<!DOCTYPE html>/,$p' > loop-dashboard.html
```

## GitHub Action

```yaml
- uses: s977043/river-review/runners/github-action@v1.22.0
  with:
    output_format: html
```

The action runs `river run` and posts its stdout as the PR comment body. GitHub strips `<style>` and similar tags from comments, so an HTML document does not render as intended there. Set `comment: false` when using `html` and consume the output from the job log or an artifact instead.

## Sample output (review report)

Structure of the document produced by `formatHtmlOutput` (the inline CSS is elided).

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="ja">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <title>River Review Report — midstream</title>
    <style>
      /* inline CSS (elided) */
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>

        <td><pre>Use with()</pre></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </body>
</html>
```

Sections appear in this order:

- Header: `phase` and `timestamp`
- Decision banner: colour-coded `auto-approve` / `human-review-recommended` / `human-review-required`
- Summary: one count chip per severity
- Score: overall plus the five axis bars (axis labels are Japanese)
- Findings: a table of severity, `file:line`, title, message, and suggestion (or a "no findings" line)
- Risk Assessment: present only when the plan carries `riskAssessment`

## Sample output (loop dashboard)

`river runs diff --output html` calls `formatLoopDashboardHtml`, whose sections differ from the review report:

- Header: number of runs and the chain of run ids
- `suggestedLoopSignal` banner: `CONVERGED` / `REVISE_REQUIRED` / `ESCALATE_HUMAN` / `STOP_OSCILLATED` / `NO_SIGNAL`
- Churn: new / resolved / persisting / oscillated count chips
- Oscillation timeline: `●` (present) and `○` (absent) per finding across runs
- New findings / Resolved findings: severity, file, and title

## Notes

- **Self-contained**: CSS is inlined and nothing external is referenced, so the single file can be shared or archived as-is.
- **HTML escaping**: every finding-derived string (file, title, message, suggestion, run id) is escaped, so a `<script>` tag in the reviewed code does not execute when the report is opened.
- **Scores are derived**: the overall and per-axis scores come from the same deterministic scoring engine as the YAML and JSON output, not from an LLM judgement. Do not decide a merge on them alone — see the scoring model in [YAML Output Format](./output-format-yaml.en.md).
- **Japanese is hard-coded**: `<html lang="ja">` and the Japanese axis labels are fixed and are not switched by the review-language setting.
