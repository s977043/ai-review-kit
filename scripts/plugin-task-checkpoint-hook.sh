# Self-contained Stop hook for the river-review plugin (#2054 PR-5, Epic #2011).
#
# Adapter for the neutral `task-checkpoint` trigger (flows/entry-map.json
# `triggers.task-checkpoint`): when the executor stops, i.e. is about to declare
# its task done, emit a Review Artifact pinned to the `review-task` Flow entry.
#
# What this hook does NOT do (ADR-009 D3, RA-1..RA-4): it holds no judgment.
# It passes ONE entry name to the CLI and nothing else — no verdict vocabulary,
# no cutoff, no branching on the review result. The Flow, the Intent and the
# skill selection all live in the repository; this file only names the entry.
#
# Fail-soft, like scripts/plugin-format-hook.sh: every missing prerequisite
# (node, git, the CLI, a readable diff) exits 0 with a one-line notice, so the
# hook never blocks the host session. The artifact is written under the
# runner's temp dir, never into the consumer's working tree.
