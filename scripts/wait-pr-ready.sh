# Wait until one or more pull requests settle, then report their state.
# Use instead of hand-writing a `for i in $(seq ...); do gh pr view ...; sleep`
# loop: those loops are retyped per session and mis-typing one turns it into an
# infinite wait or an early bail-out.
#
# The PR state is read through `gh api repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/<N>` rather than
# `gh pr view`, because `gh pr view` has been observed serving a stale head SHA
# (PR #2021). Check runs are read with the full 40-character head SHA, because
# `actions/runs?head_sha=` and `gh run list --commit` match the full SHA only and
# return zero rows with no error for an abbreviated one.
#
# SSoT for the bot-push / `action_required` stall this script surfaces:
#   docs/runbook/bot-pushed-head-kick.md
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/wait-pr-ready.sh <pr-number> [pr-number ...]
#   TIMEOUT_SECONDS=1800 INTERVAL_SECONDS=30 scripts/wait-pr-ready.sh 123 124
#   REPO=owner/repo scripts/wait-pr-ready.sh 123
#
# A head whose workflows were stalled by a bot push is reported too. Such a head
# has no check runs to fail: on PR #2023 the check-runs endpoint listed a single
# entry (`Vercel Preview Comments`) while `actions/runs?head_sha=` listed 13 runs,
# all `action_required`. The stall is therefore read from the runs endpoint, and
# it is reported as a failure rather than waited on, because waiting never clears
# it -- see the runbook for the escape.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  every PR settled with no failing check and no stalled run
#   1  at least one PR has a failing check or a stalled (`action_required`) run
#   2  timed out before every PR settled
#   64 usage error
#   65 a GitHub API read failed -- the PR state could not be determined
#
# Exit 65 exists so that a failed read is never reported as "no failing check".
# Suppressing an API error into an empty result would let a permission error, a
# rate limit, or a dropped connection produce a green exit 0.
