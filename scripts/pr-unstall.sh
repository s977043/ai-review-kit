# Detect a bot-pushed, stalled PR head and choose the escape for it.
#
# A head pushed by `github-actions[bot]` with `GITHUB_TOKEN` never runs its
# workflows: every run sits at `completed` / `action_required`, so the required
# contexts stay unreported and the PR shows `N of N required status checks are
# expected`. This script mechanises the decision that used to be made by hand:
#
#   1. read the head SHA (`repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/<N>`, full 40 chars) and its
#      workflow runs (`actions/runs?head_sha=`); one or more `action_required`
#      runs with nothing still queued / in progress means the head is stalled
#   2. a release-please head (`release-please--*`) is kicked with
#      scripts/release-please-kick.sh (empty commit from your own account)
#   3. any other head is advanced with
#      `PUT repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/<N>/update-branch`, whose merge commit is
#      pushed with your own token and therefore fires CI
#   4. a 422 from update-branch (merge conflict, or nothing to merge) cannot be
#      resolved from here: the local procedure is PRINTED, never run, because
#      it touches a working tree
#
# The cause and the decision rules stay in the `CLAUDE.md` guard
# "`N of N required checks are expected` = bot/GITHUB_TOKEN push"; the manual
# procedure stays in docs/runbook/bot-pushed-head-kick.md. This script does not
# replace either -- it runs the same steps and quotes the runbook when it stops.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/pr-unstall.sh <pr-number>             # dry-run: judge, print next command
#   scripts/pr-unstall.sh --execute <pr-number>   # run step 2 or 3
#   REPO=owner/repo scripts/pr-unstall.sh 123
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  not stalled (or already merged / closed), or the escape was executed
#   1  stalled, but not resolvable from here (422 etc.); the procedure was printed
#   2  a GitHub API read failed -- the stall could not be judged
#   64 usage error
#
# Exit 2 exists so that a failed read is never reported as "not stalled".
#
# The judging functions (`judge_stall`, `choose_route`) take JSON / strings and
# call no `gh`, so they can be exercised by sourcing this file:
#   source scripts/pr-unstall.sh && judge_stall "$(cat runs.json)"

The head is not behind its base, so update-branch has nothing to merge
(runbook Step 2, "pure BLOCKED"). The remaining escape is an empty commit
pushed from your own account:

  gh api user --jq .login | grep -q ${WRITE_ACCOUNT} || gh auth switch -u ${WRITE_ACCOUNT}
  ${script_dir}/release-please-kick.sh ${head_ref}
PROC
  else
    cat >&2 <<PROC
Resolve the conflict locally, from your own account, then push (fast-forward,
no force). This is not automated because it edits a working tree:

  git fetch origin
  git switch ${head_ref}
  git merge origin/main
  # if the only conflicts are under runners/github-action/dist/**:
  npm run build:action && git add runners/github-action/dist
  git commit            # completes the merge
  git push              # fast-forward; do not rebase, do not force
