# Advance the release-please branch by an empty commit via the GitHub REST API.
# Use when the release-please PR is BLOCKED because required status checks were
# not registered on the auto-generated branch.
#
# This script is the canonical kick procedure on this repository. It pushes the
# empty commit with your own `gh` credentials, so the new head counts as a real
# user push and re-fires `pull_request` workflows. It needs no repository secret.
#
# The .github/workflows/release-please-kick.yml route is DEPRECATED (refs #1800):
# it requires the `RELEASE_KICK_PAT` Actions secret, which is not registered
# here, so its own push cannot re-fire downstream CI and every run fails. Do not
# reach for it as an equivalent alternative.
#
# SSoT for when to kick, BEHIND vs pure BLOCKED, and RELEASE_KICK_PAT setup:
#   docs/runbook/bot-pushed-head-kick.md
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/release-please-kick.sh [branch]
#   REPO=owner/repo scripts/release-please-kick.sh [branch]
