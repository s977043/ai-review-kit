# Test Case: Singleton Closure Retaining Large Scope (Happy Path)

This test case should trigger a closure-scope-retention finding: a process-lifetime singleton
is built from closures that keep the entire enclosing scope (multi-MB raw text, parsed
documents, full entry array) reachable, even though only id -> severity pairs are ever read.

## Expected Behavior

The skill should detect that `cachedLookup` is a module-level singleton whose accessor methods
close over `rawText`, `documents`, and `allEntries` — keeping the multi-MB raw registry text and
all parsed documents alive for the process lifetime, even though only `id` and `severity` are
ever consumed. It should propose reducing at construction time: build a compact
`Map<id, severity>` (plus a `Set` of ids) up front so the closures do not capture the large
scope, letting `rawText` / `documents` / `allEntries` become unreachable after the build.
