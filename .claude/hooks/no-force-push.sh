#!/usr/bin/env bash
# PreToolUse hook (matcher: Bash): block destructive git commands deterministically.
#
# Background: AGENTS.md Safety bans commands that rewrite already-pushed branch
# history (`git push --force` / `-f` / `--force-with-lease`) or discard work
# (`git reset --hard`, `git stash drop`). That ban is stated in prose in four
# places (AGENTS.md Safety, CLAUDE.md, docs/development/worker-discipline-template.md,
# and the commands) yet still slipped through once each in #1656 and #1720.
# This hook makes the prose deterministic. `permissions.deny` was not used
# because its prefix matching lets `git push origin branch --force` through —
# a hook sees the whole command string and is argument-order independent.
#
# Contract (PreToolUse):
#   stdin  : JSON payload; the Bash tool command is .tool_input.command
#   exit 0 : allow the tool call to proceed
#   exit 2 : block the tool call; stderr is fed back to Claude
#
# Behavior:
#   - Commands that cannot contain a git invocation: exit 0 immediately.
#   - The command string is sanitized before matching: heredoc bodies are
#     dropped, line continuations are joined, and quoted segments are replaced
#     by a space (so `grep -rn -- "--force-with-lease" .` and
#     `echo "do not use git push --force"` stay allowed). A quoted segment that
#     is itself only a force flag (`git push "--force"`) is kept.
#   - Blocked: `git push` with --force / -f / --force-with-lease (any argument
#     order, `--force-with-lease=<ref>` included), `git reset --hard`,
#     `git stash drop`, `git stash clear`.
#   - Explicitly NOT blocked (non-destructive or out of the AGENTS.md scope):
#     `git fetch --tags --force` / `git fetch -f` (used by
#     .github/workflows/release-please.yml), `git tag -f`, `git clean`,
#     `git checkout -- <path>`, `git restore`. Ambiguous input is allowed:
#     a false positive stalls all development, a miss costs one incident.
#
# Known limitation: quoted text is treated as data, so an interpreter form such
# as `bash -c "git push --force"` is not detected. The hook is defense-in-depth;
# AGENTS.md Safety remains the SSoT for the ban.
