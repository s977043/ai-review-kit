# .claude/rules/

Auto-applied rules for Claude Code sessions. Each rule file has a `globs` field in its frontmatter that determines when it is loaded.

| Rule        | Glob   | Purpose                                         |
| ----------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| review-core | `**/*` | Review severity mapping and prohibited patterns |

## Why `globs: **/*` instead of a narrower path scope

`review-core` intentionally uses a catch-all `**/*` glob rather than scoping to specific paths. Claude Code's built-in `/code-review` slash command has been observed to evaluate a rule file's `paths:`/`globs:` frontmatter against the git ref-range string passed to the command (e.g. `{upstream}...HEAD`) rather than against the individual changed file paths, so a narrower glob can silently fail to load (inspired by [tyabu12's `/code-review` path-scoped rules investigation](https://zenn.dev/tyabu12/articles/0010-code-review-path-scoped-rules)). A `**/*` catch-all matches regardless of what string it is tested against, which is why this rule is kept unscoped rather than narrowed to a specific path prefix.
